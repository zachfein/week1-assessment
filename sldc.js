// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requriements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing and Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const aOR = "This is the second step, in which you find what tools and technologies you need."
const design = "This is the third step, in which you actually design the product."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, this is the actual coding part."
const tAI = "This is the fifth step, in which you make sure that the code works. After testing you integrate it, which means you have to make it available to people on other computers."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which you make sure that the code continues to work over time."
